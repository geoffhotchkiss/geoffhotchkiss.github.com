<p>
I like math and so should you. 
No, seriously. 
If you like math, want to like math, or just want to learn something cool, we should talk. 
I'm also a pretty big fan of Iron Maiden, indie disco pop, and all that terrible pop music.

Some notes about this site:
I don't really like the way this is organized. 
I think what I like about tumblr is the design of it. I may try to copy that here.
